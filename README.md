# 5eCharacterCreator

**Important:**
*For optimal use of this program, make sure you create a folder to store the npc_builder.exe file in. Upon close, the program creates three files and will store them wherever your original npc_builder.exe file is. In order to save some headache, just create a folder for your stuff. I promise you'll thank me later.*

This is a tool that will allow you to go through character creation for a Fifth Edition Dungeons and Dragons character. The original purpose of this tool was to provide DMs with a means of character creation that doesn't take an hour and constant flipping between pages.

For easy use of this program, without having to download an Ada compiler, you may simply use the npc_builder.exe file in this repository. I promise it won't bite!

Check out the Example Output folder for pictures of the program's output and the user interface. The program should be pretty straightforward, that being said.

I will also update the README with a list of tasks I still want to complete in order to get this program to it's final stages. It's by no means complete, I just ran out of time to work on it and didn't have the energy to finish what I started when I got the free time back. The tool was written using Ada '95, so feel free to contribute if you want. I'm also interested in making a variation of the tool using Python or Java so I can implement a GUI, but I haven't found time to convert the code.

To Do:
  - Output a file with race and class features. (Features.txt)
  - Output a file with available spells, if applicable. This file will have a section for known and prepared spells as well. (Spells.txt)
  - Inventory.txt
